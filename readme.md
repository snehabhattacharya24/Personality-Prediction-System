# Personality Prediction System in Human Resources Management

This project uses the unlabeled questionnaire data collected by the [Open-Source Psychometrics Project](https://openpsychometrics.org) consisting of 110 variables and over 1 million features to create a clustering model to help predict the personality of an individual.

The goal of this project was to help HR managers to predict the personality of candidates, and help determine if they would be a good fit for the role.

The project uses the K-Means and PCA algorithms for data clustering and the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset.
